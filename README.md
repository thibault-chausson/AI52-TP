# Practical Work - Operations Research

Here is a collection of practical assignments completed as part of the engineering training in artificial intelligence,
within the framework of the Operations Research module.

## TP1 - Linear Programming

This assignment aims to practice linear programming, with methods of gradient descent and conjugate gradients. [Folder TP1](TP1), [my report](TP1/regression_code.ipynb).

## TP2 - Genetic Algorithm Applied to the Knapsack Problem

This assignment aims to solve the knapsack problem, known as the KP (Knapsack Problem), using genetic algorithms. Here
is a simple description of the problem:
A thief enters a house carrying a backpack that can carry a certain weight (30 kg). The house has 10 items of different
values, each with a weight. The thief's dilemma is then to make a selection of items that maximizes the total value of
the stolen items without exceeding the weight of the backpack.
There are several applications of the knapsack problem. It is particularly used in portfolio management. For example,
with a limited budget (capacity of the bag), the problem consists of buying the securities that maximize the earnings (
values of the items) with a diversification constraint to reduce risks. It is applied to the loading of means of
transport but also to cutting problems. [Folder TP2](TP2), [my report](TP2/TP2%20-%20KnapSac.ipynb).

## TP3 - Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, and Ant Colony Optimization Applied to the TSP

This assignment aims to compare three approaches to solving the traveling salesperson problem known as TSP (travelling
salesperson problem). The three approaches are simulated annealing, the genetic algorithm, and ant colonies. Several
variants of the TSP problem exist. Also, TSP finds several practical applications such as in layout, scheduling, and
service. This assignment focuses on the basic version of the TSP. [Folder TP3](TP3), [my report](TP3/TP3.ipynb).

## TP4 - Quantum Genetic Algorithm

Quantum genetic algorithms were introduced in 1996 by A. Narayanan and M. Moore. It is more of a quantum-inspired
metaheuristic on classical computers. In this metaheuristic, individuals in the population are coded in the form of
Qubits. They evolve through rotation. The description provided here simplifies the concept to allow for the completion
of the assignment without particular notions in the field of quantum computing. [Folder TP4](TP4), [my report](TP4/TP4.ipynb).
